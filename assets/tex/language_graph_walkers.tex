\chapter{Graphs, Architypes, and Walkers in Jac}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Structure of a Jac Program}

 [Introduce structure of a jac program] \par
[Specify the differnce between graph architypes, graph instantiations, and walkers]\par
[Present simple program that utilizes the structures]\par
[Present variations on articulating the same program]\par
[Code blocks]\par

\begin{nerd}
    Grammar~\ref{gram:jac.g4:3:16} shows the lines from the formal grammar for Jac that presents the high level structure of a Jac program.
